# Budget Relief Measures

To date, the government has committed close to 100 billion dollars in four budgets to support Singaporeans in this battle against COVID-19.

An extensive portion of that monetary commitment has been set aside to stabilise the economy and protect livelihoods, as illustrated below.

* Cash payouts and subsidies will be especially helpful for affected workers who may need help with living expenses as they find new employment. 

* Eligible self-employed persons can also look forward to a cash payout of $3,000 in two payments, come July and October.

* Needy households will receive higher rebates on their utilities bills and service and conservancy charges, to ease financial strain.

# Pre-existing support schemes

Consider some of these pre-existing support schemes, which help to:

* Lower your HDB mortgage installments or sublet of room(s) to generate additional income.
 
* Offer support ranging from monetary and medical to employment if you are temporarily unable to work due to illness (or if you are a caregiver of children, elderly, or other dependants).

* Provide your school-going children with a full waiver of school fees, free textbooks and school attire, subsidies for meals and public transportation, and more.

To ensure you don’t miss out on available support, we have made it easier for you to navigate the wide range of schemes and relief measures with just a few clicks. 

Find out what you are eligible for, learn about payout amount, and how to apply.
