# Budget Relief Measures

To date, the government has committed close to 100 billion dollars in four budgets to support Singaporeans in this battle against COVID-19.

An extensive portion of that monetary commitment has been set aside to stabilise the economy and protect livelihoods, as illustrated below.

* Cash payouts and subsidies will be especially helpful for affected workers who may need help with living expenses as they find new employment. 

* Eligible self-employed persons can also look forward to a cash payout of $3,000 in two payments, come July and October.

* Needy households will receive higher rebates on their utilities bills and service and conservancy charges, to ease financial strain.

# Suite of pre-existing support schemes

Consider some of these pre-existing support schemes, which help to:

* Lower your HDB mortgage installments or sublet of room(s) to generate additional income.
 
* Offer support ranging from monetary and medical to employment if you are temporarily unable to work due to illness (or if you are a caregiver of children, elderly, or other dependants).

* Provide your school-going children with a full waiver of school fees, free textbooks and school attire, subsidies for meals and public transportation, and more.

To ensure you donâ€™t miss out on available support, we have made it easier for you to navigate the wide range of schemes and relief measures with just a few clicks. 

Find out what you are eligible for, learn about payout amount, and how to apply in time.
