# <a name="top"></a>Support is available for Singaporeans affected by COVID-19.

Whether you have lost your job (including self-employment) or suffered a drop in income due to COVID-19, know that help is available to get you through this. 

The Government has committed close to $100 billion to stabilise the economy and protect livelihoods. A significant portion is set aside as cash relief and subsidies for affected individuals. 

Those in need may also consider existing schemes that offer additional support in the immediate term for housing, healthcare, education and more.
