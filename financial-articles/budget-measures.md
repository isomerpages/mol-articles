# Budget Relief Measures

To date, the government has committed close to 100 billion dollars in four budgets to support Singaporeans in this battle against COVID-19.

An extensive portion of that monetary commitment has been set aside to stabilise the economy and protect livelihoods, as illustrated below.

* Cash payouts and subsidies will be especially helpful for affected workers who may need help with living expenses as they find new employment. 

* Eligible self-employed persons can also look forward to a cash payout of $3,000 in two payments, come July and October.

* Needy households will receive higher rebates on their utilities bills and service and conservancy charges, to ease financial strain.
